The trap-level interfaces (such as mach_msg_overwrite_trap) and message formats are themselves abstracted in normal usage by the Mach Interface Generator (MIG). MIG is used to compile procedural interfaces to the message-based APIs, based on descriptions of those APIs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mach Traps and MIG tables](https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/Mach%20Traps%20and%20MIG%20tables)\r\n\r\n## Sysctls\r\nsysctl is an interface for examining and dynamically changing parameters in Unix-like operating systems.\r\n\r\n[Sysctls](https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/Sysctls)\r\n\r\n## UNIX Syscalls \r\na system call is the programmatic way in which a computer program requests a service from the kernel of the operating system it is executed on. This may include hardware-related services (for example, accessing a hard disk drive), creation and execution of new processes, and communication with integral kernel services such as process scheduling.\r\n\r\n[UNIX syscalls](https://bitbucket.org/clevrpwn/ios-10-stuffs/wiki/UNIX%20syscalls)",
